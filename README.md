# Liquid-Crystal-Eperiments-

I have been conducting experiments on nematic liquid crystals with negative electric anisotropy (MBBA) and the effect of applying electric fields across them. Another problem we are looking into is that of nematic films on substrates such as water or glycerol. Some experiments have been successfully conducted and the work on these problems will continue in the coming months. Mentored by: Dr. Pramoda Kumar
